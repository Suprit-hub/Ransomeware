# Ransomeware
This is for educational purpose only.
This is Ransomware made by me using python.
This Programs will give an overview that how Ransom works and you can also read Countermeasures below according to me.

A ransom is malicious piece of software which encrypts(locks) all the files of the system with an unknown extension . Attacker may demand to pay the ransom using Bitcoin or any other mode of transaction.
Though after payment there is less chance that attacker may provide the decryption key to unlock those files.
If victim haves/receives the key will able to decrypt and recover those infected files.

Countermeasures :
a) Never visit unwanted websites , especially unsecured protocols which uses 'http'
b) Do not download any files like executable files or .msi (installers)
c)Do not plug in any accidentally received usb flash drives from unknown sources.

If the system is affected by Ransomware attack :
a) Do not pay ransom , because there is no guarantee that attacker will share decryption key.
b) Try to upload the infected files on https://lnkd.in/dS2_AFpD
and may get your original files back .
c) Format the system and install fresh Operating System .
